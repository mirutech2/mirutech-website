It's been around 15 days since I returned, with a heart full of memories and a belly full of food from Pondicherry, with a few of the closest friends of my life. There were 6 of us in 2 cars, one being a Tata Altroz and the other, a Nexon EV max.

## Plan
The idea of us going on a trip originated when out of pure coincidence Adyanth from the US, and Meghana from the UK ended up coming to India at the same time. After much deliberation on where to go, we narrowed in on going to Pondicherry since Adyanth, Jesty, Aniket, and Supriya had not been there. I, Ruthuja, Meghana, and Ananya had visited, so we had a fair idea of what to expect. We narrowed the dates to 14th to 16th September and we wanted to budget out of this trip (Ultimately ended up splurging on food), so we booked the same [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/32482359?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=b90244aa-1cdc-4517-883f-1f065910c13f) where we had stayed previously as it would cost us ~1000 INR for the 2-night stay. The travel in 2 cars was expected to be around 1500 INR per person. But due to unforeseen circumstances, Jesty and Ananya dropped out at the nth moment. Aniket came up with the itinerary for the trip and he did a wonderful job at it.

## Day 1
Adyanth, Aniket, and Supriya started in the Nexon at around 5 AM with an hour head start since there would be charging time delays in the ~450km journey we were aboubt to do today. Myself and Meghana started at around 6:15am from Mysuru and reached Kengeri metro station around 7:45am to pick Ruthuja who had stayed back in Bengaluru. By this time Adyanth, who was driving the Nexon EV, had a pitstop at [Kadamba Veg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UCqDgLcyBkctbZoZ7), topped up and had almost reached [Hotel Hills](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CjCTVLTu4pa4MFF87) where we had planned for breakfast and charge the car to a 100%. By the time the car reached a 100%, I driving my Altroz, also reached the same place. The Nexon folks left to their next pit stop at [Krishnagiri]() and we had decided that we'd meet up for lunch at [Saravanna Bhavan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/THzEFw95Xvo3M3WX6) where there was Zeon charger which would again get us to a 100%. Ruthuja, Meghana, and I in the Altoz did take our own sweet time i.e., we did not start from hotel hills for ~50 minutes after the Nexon started. But I do not know what Adyanth was doing driving the Nexon, because I ended up reaching our lunch destination earlier than him and I never crossed 100kmph. After lunch we started towards Pondicherry and reached our stay around 3:30PM. We checked in, freshened up and we were all ready to explore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At around 5:30 PM the 6 of us, started towards Rock Beach with its proximity to French town being a plus. We spent around an hour to 90 minutes at the beach before we headed out to [Cozy resto Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fqJywd6mVKNKJtGo6) for dinner. The food was pretty good and below is a picture that was clicked by Supriya of us at Rock Beach.

Once we were done with dinner we decided to get some ice-cream at the [Gelato factory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5X7B4Y4w5VjcMdQT7) and retreated to our rooms where we spent some time chitchatting before we called it a day.

## Day 2
The day started with Me, Meghana, Ruthuja, and Supriya waking up pretty early to go watch the sunrise at [Auroville Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L9heBqdn7VmsWgzh6) and thankfully there were not many clouds. So we were able to view a lovely sunrise. Once done, we returned to our rooms and the girls dozed off to complete their sleep quotas. The boys were hungry and we moved towards [Auro Jars bakery and Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZXHLYA4RyoFTJmQ8) for breakfast and I have to say we tried a few dosas, pancakes, and a few other items and unfortunately, it did not live up to its hype. We then got some food packed for the girls and headed back to our room, rested for a while and headed towards [Auroville Matrimandir](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KnmuwbQYYoTxEMQ77). Meghana and Ruthuja decided to stay back in the room since they had already visited the place.

After Matrimandir we visited the famous [Coromandel Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x1jodo8goPZJssn58) and I must say, the ambience of the place is lovely. Not many options in terms of food for vegetarians though. But whatever was available, was good and my talking here doesn't justify the vibes of the place. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Eden Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eF9M4BCSQyHdLGDB6), classified as one of the blue flag beaches was next in our itinerary and boy was it worth it. The cool breeze from the sea along with the sun setting towards our backs, the atmosphere turned out to be magical and we were able to click many pictures among which the below 2 are my favourite.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beach closed around 6:30 PM, we finished our dinner at [Escape In](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FD8oiFFCadiU7e247), got some Ice-Cream at [Gelateria Montecatini Terme](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LaeZUNLJsCdezw9a7) and returned to rock beach when it started drizzling. I'm not sure why, but this is one of those beaches where one feels like going again and again and again... We spent over an hour there again, before having to return to our rooms as we had a travel day coming up.

## Day 3
The entire gang did not want to miss the sunrise this day and surprisingly everyone was awake and ready by 5:30 AM and we reached Auroville beach by 5:50 AM for sunrise. Although it was much cloudier than the previous day, the sun did make a guest appearance for a few minutes, and we got some beautiful pictures during this. Below is one such one where it looks like the sun has just ignited the sky with his fury.

Once done with the sunrise, we went to our rooms, packed, checked out, and reached [Baker Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x5PrUq7ryxKZ2meKA) for breakfast and the taste was the same as 4 years ago, simply lovely. Having finished breakfast, and charged the EV to 100% at [Ginger Pondicherry](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bLwJHXProQfRVgVP9), our next destination was the mangrove forests which we wanted to explore, but unfortunately, after reaching the destination through some insane traffic, we were made aware that there is no water, and hence boating has been closed. The situation was so grim that we could see a person walking there in ankle-deep water :(

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we started our journey back to Mysuru with stops at [Saravanna Bhavan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/THzEFw95Xvo3M3WX6) for lunch, [Regency](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7JQRFi8rS1WiZh659) for a snack, [Surya Complex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XByZT3Nn7go2AQfj8) for dinner, and [Kadamba Veg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UCqDgLcyBkctbZoZ7) for a topup. This came to be about 520km and we reached Mysuru at 2:30 AM on the 17th as we took plenty of leisurely breaks along the way having started from Pondicherry around 2:30 PM on the 16th. I do have to mention that it was Ruthuja who drove my Altroz back and she did a wonderful job at it after a bit of fine-tuning at the start.

## Expenses
The toll costs came up to 1475 INR for each vehicle to and fro, with 640 of these for the Mysuru-Bengaluru expressway and 290 for the NICE road from Kengeri to Electronic City. We travelled 1050.5 km in the Altroz which cost us 6079 and the EV charging cost us 4460. The breakup of this is as per the below table. As you might have seen now, the places we visited to eat were not the most pocket-friendly ones and hence, the trip ended up costing ~7000 INR per person.
