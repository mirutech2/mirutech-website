## Hello World

Well, hello there. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and read my blog. So how did this all start for me? How and where did I get the idea of having my website and starting to write my Blogs on it? Also, what do I intend to do with this?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small story, to be honest. I came across a section of a YouTube video by [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips) where Linus talks about the 3-2-1 strategy. The basic concept of the 3-2-1 backup strategy is that three copies are made of the data to be protected, the copies are stored on two different types of storage media and one copy of the data is sent off-site. Whatever data I had at the time, was 2 copies, one on my hard disk and the other on my personal computer. Now I wanted to make a third copy of this and started to explore places where I could back this up and the obvious solution was any cloud service provider. The two most popular ones were Onedrive and Googledrive and I ended up choosing the former as it was more cost-effective. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft had this offering called [Business 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products-b?ef_id=_k_Cj0KCQjwho-lBhC_ARIsAMpgModmZJHsW0GS5AQbgVTDOHFflSPK8MdP0CtUiwp4pxQxCcirbkWLVDsaAsQdEALw_wcB_k_&OCID=AIDcmmapr1szny_SEM__k_Cj0KCQjwho-lBhC_ARIsAMpgModmZJHsW0GS5AQbgVTDOHFflSPK8MdP0CtUiwp4pxQxCcirbkWLVDsaAsQdEALw_wcB_k_&gclid=Cj0KCQjwho-lBhC_ARIsAMpgModmZJHsW0GS5AQbgVTDOHFflSPK8MdP0CtUiwp4pxQxCcirbkWLVDsaAsQdEALw_wcB) and I chose the cheapest one available. This gave me access to a whole bunch of services with one of them being the ability to host an email exchange server. My friend [**Adyanth**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adyanth-h/) was already using this by now and seeing how this subscription was so useful made me get on the 365 business basic plan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious next step was to register my domain and set it up on my exchange server. I ended up registering my domain in Google Domains and did the needed setup on my mail server. Once I completed this, I wanted to build my website and was exploring how to do this. Again, this is where my friend Adyanth came in and introduced me to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This just needed me to write all my content in a markup file and not worry about HTML/CSS/JS (Not that I knew any of these languages). Adyanth already having his [website](https://adyanth.site/) based on Hugo, did make my life easier as he was able to give me a quick start on Hugo and how things work in it. After this, I found this [cool theme](https://hugo-profile.netlify.app/) on which I have based my website. A big shoutout to [Guru Sabarish](https://github.com/gurusabarish) for coming up with this theme.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to keep blogging about my experiences on both professional as well as personal things that happen in my life, which may or may not be limited to projects, travel experiences, quick hacks, and so on. Also, I hope to be able to help students of Electronics who might need help with their technical projects. So please feel free to reach out to me at *miru@mirutech.dev* and we can discuss anything and everything.
