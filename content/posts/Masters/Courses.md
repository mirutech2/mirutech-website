## Background
I always had the ambition of doing a master's in the USA and getting into a job was never on my radar after completing my bachelor's. But as life turned out, I got hired by Cypress on July 24th, 2018 and my plan of doing an MS in the US went down the drain. But I did want to get a master's, but how and when wasn't clear yet. After getting into my job, I got to know that Cypress assisted people who wanted to do a corporate M.Tech program and it was pretty clear to me that this is how I'll get my master's. I wanted to get started with M.Tech as a working professional in 2020. The only decision left was for me to decide whether I would take up the program in embedded systems from [BITS-Pilani](https://bits-pilani-wilp.ac.in/m-tech/embedded-systems.php) or Integrated Circuits and Systems from [IIT-Madras](https://code.iitm.ac.in/integratedcircuits). After much deliberation, I decided that I would start my master's at IIT-Madras. I cleared the entrance test, got a roll number allotted and was notified that my classes would start in September 2020.

## Intent
In this blog, I will try to make a summary of the courses I covered and what each of them involved and try to mention the faculty professors also that covered them. I will also link if there are any youtube/NPTEL equivalent courses available for the same.
