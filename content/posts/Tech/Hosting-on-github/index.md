## Hugo Website

One can get started by building their website on Hugo. From a Windows user perspective, all that needs to be done is download the binary from [git](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.118.0) and add the location to the environment variables of your systems. Then follow Hugo's [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). Once you are done with building the content needed for your webpage using Hugo, you can follow the steps mentioned [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/). This will help you get a webpage up and running with a 'github.io' link.
